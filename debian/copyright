Comment:
 This file originates from Python's fnmatch.py and thus inherits its PSF-2,

Comment:
 This file contains two bundled javascript libraries qrcode.js by Kazuhiko
 Arase and SHA-256 by Chris Veness. Both of these embedded libraries are MIT
 while the file as a whole also applies BSD-3-clause like the rest of the
 code base.
